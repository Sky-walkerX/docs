Clueless about Linux but still want to join the cool kids club? Start here. Seriously, you won‚Äôt cry (much).

## Booting into Fedora

### Step 1: Download the ISO

Grab the Fedora Workstation ISO from [here](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download). Yes, you need an ISO. No, not the camera setting.

---

### Step 2: Burn That ISO üî•

Time to turn your USB into a bootable Fedora launcher. You‚Äôll need a USB stick or SD card (minimum 8GB unless you're into living dangerously).

Use one of these tools:
- [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) ‚Äî beginner-proof (a monkey could use it)
- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) ‚Äî Windows-y but solid
- [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/) ‚Äî for the tinkerers

#### Using Balena Etcher (because we like pretty UIs):

1. Download and open it.
2. Plug in your USB (double-check it's empty or useless ‚Äî it *will* be wiped).
3. Set:
   - **File**: Your freshly downloaded Fedora ISO
   - **Target**: Your USB
4. Hit **Flash!** and let it do its thing.

<img

    alt="Balena Etcher"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Boom. You now have a Fedora USB that's boot-ready.

---

### Step 3: Shrink That Windows Partition (Sorry, Windows)

1. Hit `Win + X` ‚Üí Disk Management
2. Right-click your C: drive ‚Üí "Shrink Volume"
3. Shrink by ~50-100GB (more if you want Fedora to stretch its legs)
4. Voil√† ‚Äî now you‚Äôve got unallocated space Fedora can colonize.

---

### Step 4: Boot Into the Fedora USB

Time to break into your BIOS like a hacker in a bad movie.

1. Reboot your PC.
2. Smash your boot key repeatedly like it owes you money.
   - **F12** ‚Äì Dell, Lenovo, Acer
   - **Esc** ‚Äì HP, ASUS
   - **F11** ‚Äì MSI (because why not)

3. Select the USB that says ‚ÄúFedora‚Äù or something equally obvious.

    alt="Install or Test"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

You‚Äôll be given the option to test or install Fedora. Feel free to poke around, or just send it and click **Install**.

---

## Welcome to Fedora üéâ

You made it this far. Congrats. You‚Äôll see the Fedora welcome screen ‚Äî hit **Install** unless you want to admire the boot screen forever.

## Installation

### Language

Pick a language. No, Klingon isn‚Äôt available. Click **Continue**.

---

### Installation Destination

This part scares people. It shouldn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs the cheat sheet:

<Danger>
**It is scary, believe me, I don't lie**

This is where you could accidentally wipe your entire disk. Pay attention.
</Danger>

You‚Äôve got four options:
1. **Install alongside your other OS** (the lazy-safe route, just select this we are doing custom partitioning only for the sake of it, this is best for beginners)
2. **Wipe the whole disk** (bold move, crazy people only)
3. **Mount existing stuff** (not for us, skip it)
4. **Custom Partitioning** (because we‚Äôre doing this like pros)

If you choose the first option, Fedora will handle everything for you. Just check the box so that it uses Unallocated Space we created earlier.

If you are going with any other option than the last one, you can skip the rest of this section and go to the next one.

Click the menu icon in the top-right to launch the storage editor.

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/StorageEditor.jpg" 
    alt="Storage Editor"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Select the **unallocated space** (from the shrinking earlier), hit the **+**, and let‚Äôs make some partitions.

#### Partition 1: EFI

Because UEFI is fancy.

- **Size**: 512MB (not 300MB like the image, ignore it)
- **Type**: EFI System Partition
- **Mount Point**: `/boot/efi`

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/EFI.jpg" 
    alt="EFI Partition"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

<Danger>
Yep, the image is lying about the size. It‚Äôs 512MB. Not negotiable.
</Danger>

#### Partition 2: Swap

When RAM gets tired, Swap steps in.

- **Size**: Same as your RAM (or 2√ó if your RAM is sad and tiny)
- **Type**: Swap

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/Swap.jpg" 
    alt="Swap Partition"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

<Danger>
Image is still lying. Don‚Äôt trust its numbers either.
</Danger>

#### Partition 3: Root

Where Fedora lives.

- **Size**: Whatever‚Äôs left
- **Type**: EXT4 (or BTRFS if you like feeling special)
- **Mount Point**: `/`

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/Root.jpg" 
    alt="Root Partition"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Click **Return to Installation**, verify it all looks like this:

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/ConfirmMounted.jpg" 
    alt="Confirm Mounted"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Then this:

<img
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/UseConfiguredStorage.jpg" 
    alt="Configured Storage"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Hit **Next**, review everything (pretend you read it), and then click **Install**.

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/Install.jpg" 
    alt="Review and Install"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Let it install. Grab a snack. Or cry. Your call.

When it‚Äôs done:

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/Done.jpg" 
    alt="Done"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Click **Exit to Live Desktop**, reboot from the top-right menu, and eject the USB. Welcome to Fedora-land.

## Finalizing the Installation

Now Fedora asks you a bunch of setup questions because apparently it's needy.

### Language & Keyboard

- Pick what you want. Stick with **US English** unless you're a keyboard masochist.

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/LanguageAndKeyboard.png" 
    alt="Language and Keyboard"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

### Privacy & Location

- Want your laptop knowing where you are? Enable it.
- Paranoid or battery-conscious? Turn it off.

### Timezone

- Select Asia/Kolkata or wherever you actually live. Don‚Äôt lie.

### Third-Party Repos

- This lets you install stuff Fedora pretends doesn‚Äôt exist (like proprietary drivers and media codecs). Enable it. You‚Äôll thank yourself later.

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/ThirdParty.png" 
    alt="Third Party Repositories"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

### Create a User

- Enter your name, username, password.
- Pro tip: **Don't forget the password**. Tattoo it if you must.

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/Fedora/Profile.png" 
    alt="Create User"
    className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Click through the rest, and boom ‚Äî Fedora is officially yours.

## Post-Installation Stuff (The Boring but Necessary Bits)

### Update Everything (Because Why Not?)

Open a terminal and do this:

```bash
sudo dnf up
```

Yes, you can `up`, `update` or `upgrade`. Fedora‚Äôs cool like that.

### Install Stuff You Actually Want
- Fedora comes with almost nothing you want. Fix that.

Want VLC?

```bash
sudo dnf install vlc
```
Want something else?

```bash
sudo dnf search <package-name>
```
Go wild. Or don‚Äôt. You do you.
