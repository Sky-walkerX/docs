title: 'Arch Linux'
description: "Minimal Arch Installation Guide, this one is a bit complex and dangerous so continue with caution. This'll be minimal install after which you'll need to install your own packages or someone else's dots using their installation scripts"
---
<Tip>
I suggest not installing this until you are familiar enough with Linux and reading Docs
Its partitioning step is very risky for Beginners
</Tip>

## Burning the ISO

Download Arch linux iso file from https://archlinux.org

Burn the downloaded iso into a pendrive or SD card using [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) _(great tool for beginners)_, [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/)

#### ðŸ’¡ Check: Is your system UEFI or BIOS?

On **Windows**:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `msinfo32` and press Enter
2. Look for **"BIOS Mode"**:
   - If it says **UEFI**, choose **GPT**
   - If it says **Legacy**, choose **MBR**

---

#### ðŸ”§ Example using Rufus (Windows):

1. Download and open [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)
2. Insert your USB drive
3. Set the following:
   - **Device**: Select your USB drive
   - **Boot selection**: Click **SELECT** and choose the `archlinux-*.iso` file
   - **Partition scheme**:
     - Use **MBR** for Legacy BIOS boot
     - Use **GPT** for UEFI boot
   - **File system**: Leave as **FAT32**
4. Click **START**
5. If prompted, choose **"Write in ISO Image mode (Recommended)"**
6. Wait until it finishes flashing the ISO

Your USB is now ready to boot into Arch Linux.

---

#### Shrinking Windows Partition

1. Open Disk Management (Win + X â†’ Disk Management)
2. Right-click C: â†’ Shrink Volume
3. Enter amount in MB, ideal is to shrink around 50GB-100GB as per available storage
4. After it you will see unallocated space, this is the space that Arch will use.

---

#### Entering in BIOS
1. Restart your PC
2. As soon as it turns on, press the BIOS key repeatedly
Common keys:
    - F2 (Dell, Lenovo, Acer, ASUS)
    - Del (MSI, ASUS desktops)
    - F10 / Esc (HP)
    - F12 (boot menu on many systems)
3. Disable Secure Boot
4. Set USB as first boot device (in Boot Order)

## Boot Into the Pendrive
Type the following commands
```bash
# Makes the font a bit bigger
setfont ter-132n
```
```bash
# A utility to help you connect to internet for now
iwctl
```
```bash
# Lists the available networking devices on your pc like wifi (generally wlan0) and ethernet
device list
```
```bash
# Lists the available wifi networks in the vicinity
station wlan0 get-networks
```
```bash
# Connects to the wifi with name 'WifiName' if given correct password
station wlan0 connect WifiName
```
Type the passphrase/password

```bash
# Exit the iwctl utility
exit
```
```bash
# Clears the terminal
clear
```
```bash
# Updates the package database to the latest
pacman -Sy
```
```bash
pacman -S archlinux-keyring
```
## Partitioning
<Warning>
This is a very __delicate__ step, slightest mistakes will lead to complete wiping of your data so proceed with caution
</Warning>
```bash
# Lets you see the partitions
lsblk
```

```bash
# A utility to help you partition your disks
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

<img 
    src="/images/LinuxGuides/ArchPartitionTable.png"
    alt="Arch Partition Table Image"
    className="rounded-lg"
/>

Select the free space and make sure `New` is selected on command bar at the bottom

    1. Create 800M type EFI system partition
        <img 
            src="/images/LinuxGuides/ArchCreatePartition.png"
            alt="Arch Create Partition Image"
            className="rounded-lg"
        />

        - Press `Enter`

        <img 
            src="/images/LinuxGuides/ArchPartitionTypes.png"
            alt="Arch Partition Types Image"
            className="rounded-lg"
        />

        - Select the newly created partition (i.e p5 here).
        - Go on `Type` and press `Enter`.

        <img 
            src="/images/LinuxGuides/ArchSelectPartitionType.png"
            alt="Arch Select Partition Type Image"
            className="rounded-lg"
        />

        - Choose EFI

    2. Create 8G (or whatever your ram is) type Linux swap partition

    3. Create remaining type Linux filesystem partition

write the changes to the disk and quit
```bash
# Formats the following partition as FAT-32 (File Access Table)
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/[efi_partition_name]
```
```bash
# Formats the following partition as EXT4 (Extended File System)
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[root_partition_name]
```
```bash
# Formats the following partition as Swap for the Linux
mkswap /dev/[swap_partition_name]
```
```bash
# Mounts (Links) the Root partition to /mnt
mount /dev/[root_partition_name] /mnt
```
```bash
# Create a new directory named boot in /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
```
```bash
# Mount the EFI partition to this newly created boot folder
mount /dev/[efi_partition_name] /mnt/boot
```
```bash
# Start using the Swap
swapon /dev/[swap_partition_name]
```
Check if they are mounted properly using lsblk command

```bash
# Install Some basic Utilities
#   git                     => for version control
#   sudo                    => for running commands as admin
#   fastfetch               => view your system info
#   bluez and bluez-utils   => for bluetooth support
#   btop                    => task manager for linux
#   nano                    => minimal terminal based text-editor

# Replace intel-ucode with amd-ucode if you have an AMD Processor
pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware git sudo fastfetch btop intel-ucode nano bluez bluez-utils networkmanager
```
```bash
# Generate default mounting configuration
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```
```bash
# Display the File Contents (Just to check)
cat /mnt/etc/fstab
```
```bash
# Changes the root directory to /mnt i.e. our root partition which will be opened every time we boot into linux
arch-chroot /mnt
```
```bash
fastfetch
```
```bash
# Sets the password for the ROOT user
passwd
```
type the password

```bash
# Creates a New user and gives them permissions
useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,video,audio -s /bin/bash [username]
```
```bash
# Sets the password for the user with the given username
passwd [username]
```
type the password

```bash
# Use nano editor and modify user and group permissions
EDITOR=nano visudo
```
scroll and uncomment `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
This will make the user with wheel group kind of like Administrator
Ctrl+O to save changes, Ctrl+X to exit

```bash
# Login to the shell as the given user
su - [username]
```
```bash
# Updates the packages
sudo pacman -Syu
```
```bash
# Exit the user shell
exit
```
```bash
# Sets the local time of the pc to be GMT+0530 i.e. India
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
```
```bash
# Synchronize the system clock
hwclock --systohc
```
```bash
# Open the local.gen file so that we can generate locale files
nano /etc/locale.gen
```
scroll and uncomment `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`

```bash
# Generate the locale based on locale.gen file
locale-gen
```
```bash
nano /etc/locale.conf
```
write `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

```bash
# Sets the hostname for the Linux installation (I generally like to keep it archlinux)
nano /etc/hostname
```
write `archlinux` or whatever you prefer

```bash
# Configure default hostname mappings with ip addresses
nano /etc/hosts
```
type the following after 2 line gap

```bash
# Install packages required to set GRUB as bootloader
pacman -S grub efibootmgr dosfstools mtools
```
```bash
# Install GRUB
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
```
```bash
# Create/Update GRUB config based on /etc/default/grub
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
```bash
# Enable Bluetooth service
systemctl enable bluetooth
```
```bash
# Enable Networking service i.e. Wifi/Ethernet
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```
```bash
# Exits
exit
```
```bash
umount -lR /mnt
```
```bash
# Shutdown the PC
shutdown now
```
Now Remove the USB drive and start the PC

Boot into Arch Linux and then login with your username (case-sensetive)
```bash
# Doubles the font size
setfont -d
```
```bash
# Use Network Manager CLI to view device status
nmcli dev status
```
```bash
# Switch on the Wifi
nmcli radio wifi on
```
```bash
# List the available WiFi networks
nmcli dev wifi list
```
```bash
# Connect to the wifi with the name `WifiName` and password `WifiPass`
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect WifiName password "WifiPass"
```
```bash
# Update all the packages
sudo pacman -Syu
```
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
set grub timeout to 20 sec

uncomment grub disable os prober = false
This will make you able to boot into Windows
you will see a new option in grub named "Windows..."

write the changes and exit
```bash
# Update the grub config
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
