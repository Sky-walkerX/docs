title: 'Arch Linux'
description: "Minimal Arch Installation Guide, this one is a bit complex and dangerous so continue with caution. This'll be minimal install after which you'll need to install your own packages or someone else's dots using their installation scripts"
---
<Tip>
I suggest not installing this until you are familiar enough with Linux and reading Docs
It's partitioning step is very risky for Beginners
</Tip>

## Burning the ISO

Download Arch linux iso file from https://archlinux.org

Burn the downloaded iso into a pendrive or SD card using [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) _(great tool for beginners)_, [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/)

Go into BIOS and disable Secure Boot
## Boot Into the Pendrive
Type the following commands
```bash
# Makes the font a bit bigger
setfont ter-132n
```
```bash
# A utility to help you connect to internet for now
iwctl
```
```bash
# Lists the available networking devices on your pc like wifi (generally wlan0) and ethernet
device list
```
```bash
# Lists the available wifi networks in the vicinity
station wlan0 get-networks
```
```bash
# Connects to the wifi with name 'WifiName' if given correct password
station wlan0 connect WifiName
```
Type the passphrase/password

```bash
# Exit the iwctl utility
exit
```
```bash
# Clears the terminal
clear
```
```bash
# Updates the package database to the latest
pacman -Sy
```
```bash
pacman -S archlinux-keyring
```
## Partitioning
<Warning>
This is a very __delicate__ step, slightest mistakes will lead to complete wiping of your data so proceed with caution
</Warning>
```bash
# Lets you see the partitions
lsblk
```
```bash
# A utility to help you partition your disks
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```
create 800M type EFI system partition

create 8G (or whatever your ram is) type Linux swap partition

create remaining type Linux filesystem partition

write the changes to the disk and quit
```bash
# Formats the following partition as FAT-32 (File Access Table)
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/[efi_partition_name]
```
```bash
# Formats the following partition as EXT4 (Exteneded File System)
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[root_partition_name]
```
```bash
# Formats the following partition as Swap for the Linux
mkswap /dev/[swap_partition_name]
```
```bash
# Mounts (Links) the Root partition to /mnt
mount /dev/[root_partition_name] /mnt
```
```bash
# Create a new directory named boot in /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
```
```bash
# Mount the EFI partition to this newly created boot folder
mount /dev/[efi_partition_name] /mnt/boot
```
```bash
# Start using the Swap
swapon /dev/[swap_partition_name]
```
Check if they are mounted properly using lsblk command

```bash
# Install Some basic Utilities
#   git                     => for version control
#   sudo                    => for running commands as admin
#   fastfetch               => view your system info
#   bluez and bluez-utils   => for bluetooth support
#   btop                    => task manager for linux
#   nano                    => minimal terminal based text-editor

# Replace intel-ucode with amd-ucode if you have an AMD Processor
pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware git sudo fastfetch btop intel-ucode nano bluez bluez-utils networkmanager
```
```bash
# Generate default mounting configuration
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```
```bash
# Display the File Contents (Just to check)
cat /mnt/etc/fstab
```
```bash
# Changes the root directory to /mnt i.e. our root partition which will be opened every time we boot into linux
arch-chroot /mnt
```
```bash
fastfetch
```
```bash
# Sets the password for the ROOT user
passwd
```
type the password

```bash
# Creates a New user and gives them permissions
useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,video,audio -s /bin/bash [username]
```
```bash
# Sets the password for the user with the given username
passwd [username]
```
type the password

```bash
# Use nano editor and modify user and group permissions
EDITOR=nano visudo
```
scroll and uncomment `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
This will make the user with wheel group kind of like Administrator
Ctrl+O to save changes, Ctrl+X to exit

```bash
# Login to the shell as the given user
su - [username]
```
```bash
# Updates the packages
sudo pacman -Syu
```
```bash
# Exit the user shell
exit
```
```bash
# Sets the local time of the pc to be GMT+0530 i.e. India
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
```
```bash
# Synchronize the system clock
hwclock --systohc
```
```bash
# Open the local.gen file so that we can generate locale files
nano /etc/locale.gen
```
scroll and uncomment `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`

```bash
# Generate the locale based on locale.gen file
locale-gen
```
```bash
nano /etc/locale.conf
```
write `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

```bash
# Sets the hostname for the Linux installation (I generally like to keep it archlinux)
nano /etc/hostname
```
write `archlinux` or whatever you prefer

```bash
# Configure default hostname mappings with ip addresses
nano /etc/hosts
```
type the following after 2 line gap

```bash
# Install packages required to set GRUB as bootloader
pacman -S grub efibootmgr dosfstools mtools
```
```bash
# Install GRUB
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
```
```bash
# Create/Update GRUB config based on /etc/default/grub
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
```bash
# Enable Bluetooth service
systemctl enable bluetooth
```
```bash
# Enable Networking service i.e. Wifi/Ethernet
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```
```bash
# Exits
exit
```
```bash
umount -lR /mnt
```
```bash
# Shutdown the PC
shutdown now
```
Now Remove the USB drive and start the PC

Boot into Arch Linux and then login with your username (case-sensetive)
```bash
# Doubles the font size
setfont -d
```
```bash
# Use Network Manager CLI to view device status
nmcli dev status
```
```bash
# Switch on the Wifi
nmcli radio wifi on
```
```bash
# List the available WiFi networks
nmcli dev wifi list
```
```bash
# Connect to the wifi with the name `WifiName` and password `WifiPass`
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect WifiName password "WifiPass"
```
```bash
# Update all the packages
sudo pacman -Syu
```
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
set grub timeout to 20 sec

uncomment grub disable os prober = false
This will make you able to boot into Windows
you will see a new option in grub named "Windows..."

write the changes and exit
```bash
# Update the grub config
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

And we are all done, now you can go install some dotfiles like the following

## Dotfiles
Files starting with a `.` are called Dotfiles, these are hidden and generally contain configurations and secrets
